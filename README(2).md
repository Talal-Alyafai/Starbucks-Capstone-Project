# Starbucks-Capstone-Project

This repository contains the complete codebase and report for my Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree Capstone project.

## Project Overview :

The goal of this project is to analyze customer behavior on the Starbucks rewards mobile app by combining transactional, demographic, and offer data to determine which demographic groups respond most effectively to different types of offers, and to build a predictive model that enhances offer targeting to maximize customer engagement and revenue.

## Problem Statement :

Starbucks aims to optimize its marketing efforts by predicting customer responses to different types of promotional offers (e.g., BOGO, discounts, informational). The company wants to identify which customers are most likely to respond to each type of offer to increase customer engagement and maximize sales.
